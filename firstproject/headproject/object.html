<h1>Sweet Night</h1>
<br>
<p>By Kim Taehyung</p>
<br>
<p>On my pillow<br>
Can't get me tired <br>
Sharing my fragile truth<br>
That I still hope the door is open<br>
Cause the window<br>
Opened one time with you and me <br>
Now my forever's falling down<br>
Wondering if you'd want me now</p>

<p>How could I know<br>
One day I'll wake up feeling more<br>
But I had already reached the shore<br>
Guess we were ships in the night,night,night<br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah <br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah<br>
We were ships in the night,night,night</p>
<p>I'm wondering,are you my best friend<br>
Feels like a river's rushing through my mind <br>
I wanna ask you if this is all just in my head <br>
My heart is pounding tonight,I wonder <br>
If you  are too good to be true<br>
And would it be alright if I <br>
Pulled you closer</p>
<p>How could I know<br>
One day I'll wake up feeling more<br>
But I had already reached the shore<br>
Guess we were ships in the night,night,night<br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah <br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah<br>
We were ships in the night,night,night</p>
