<h1>"Special Characters"</h1>
Since &lt; &gt; and &amp; have special meaning in HTML, you can't use these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called "Special Characters" to represent them. For example, to have a  less than sign appear in your document, you need to use &lt; to represent it.
